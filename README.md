# Parking Lot

- This project is a Spring Boot API to park and unpark a vehicle from a parking lot.
- It exposes two Http POST endpoints for this purpose:
  - /park -> for parking a vehicle
  - /unpark -> to remove a vehicle from parking


## Sample request body for /park and /unpark:
```
{
    "vehicleType" : "car",
    "registrationNumber" : "KAB123867"
}
```
- Here, "registrationNumber" is a unique identification for a vehicle, and "vehicleType" describes the kind of vehice being parked (Car, Truck, etc.)


## Sample response for parking a vehicle:
```
{
    "status": "Successful",
    "parkingSpot": {
        "vehicle": {
            "registrationNumber": "KAB123867",
            "vehicleType": "CAR",
            "parkingSpotType": "CAR"
        },
        "vehicleParkStartTime": 1703271748017,
        "feePerHour": 2.0
    }
}
```
## Sample resopnse for removing a vehicle from parking lot
```
{
    "status": "Successful",
    "parkingFee": "Â£0.0292"
}
```
## Sample response when trying to park in a parking lot that is full
```
{
    "errorMessage": "Parking Lot is full."
}
```

## Software Design
- The software implements Factory Design Pattern and Strategy Design Pattern for reusability and maintainability.
- The application has Parent classes Vehicle and ParkingSpot. From this, different types of vehicles such as Car, Bikecan be extended from Vehicle and different parking spots such as CarParkingSpot can be extended from ParkingSpot. This allows tremendous flexibility such as assigning different hourly parking rates for each vehicle types, etc.

- Similarly, an interface called ParkingLot is created so that we can implement different types of parking lots during the lifetime of the application. Here, a CopyOnWriteArrayList is used to add vehicles parked. This implementation has been developed as DefaultParkingLot class in the application.

- This will allow us to create different implementations of ParkingLot in the future. A factory class call ParkingLotFactory is also available to create instances of the desired implementation of ParkingLot.
